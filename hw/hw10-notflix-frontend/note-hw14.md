## p16: Resolve data for Movie Detail Page

## p19: Infinity Scroll or Virtual scrolling

## p20: Record the Movie List position

### The list data must be stored along with the scroll position

- The scroll position should be stored to restore the user's position when they return to the list page.
- However, storing only the scroll position is not sufficient for the feature to work as expected.
- The data corresponding to the scroll position must also be cached to ensure the position is valid upon return.
- Therefore, both the list data and the scroll position should be cached to provide a seamless user experience.

## p22: Update user Role
